       "' Partitioning in a database involves intentionally breaking down a large database into smaller ones. This method has nothing to do with network partitions (netsplits), which are faults in the network between nodes. The main differences between partitioning and network partitions are as follows:\\n\\n- **Partitioning**: It is a technique used within databases to divide a large dataset into smaller parts, known as partitions or shards. Each partition contains a subset of the data, making it easier for the database system to manage and query these subsets efficiently. The purpose is to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability by distributing the load across multiple nodes or servers.\\n- **Network Partitions**: These are faults in the network between nodes where communication between different parts of the network becomes impossible, leading to isolated segments that cannot exchange data or information. This type of fault typically results from hardware failures, configuration issues, or other network disruptions.\\n\\n**Directly used pages for this answer:**\\n- i. Partitioning, as discussed in this chapter, is a way of intentionally breaking a large database down into smaller ones. It has nothing to do with network partitions (netsplits), a type of fault in the network between nodes. We will discuss such faults in Chapter 8.'"
